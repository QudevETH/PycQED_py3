# Demo Notebooks for pycQED

Several demonstration jupyter notebooks exist to help you familiarize yourself with 
the various functionalities in pycqed. 
All notebooks are located in `PycQED_Notebooks/demo`. 
To install `PycQED_Notebooks`, refer to 
[the QuDev Wiki](https://qudevwiki.phys.ethz.ch/index.php/QCoDeS_and_PycQED#PycQED_Notebooks_Installation).

In case you encounter issues or bug with a demo notebook, please report them
to the demo notebook responsible


## Introduction to pycQED
This notebook introduces you to the basics of pycqed. If you have never worked 
with pycqed before, that is the place to start.

Responsible:   [Stefania Lazar](http://qudev.slack.com/team/U40NC4XP0)

## Introduction to the Circuit Builder
This notebook introduces you to functionalities of the circuit builder,
the base class of all QuantumExperiment.

Responsible:  [Nathan Lacroix](http://qudev.slack.com/team/UHSC3DC0K)

## Initial Sample Tuneup

This notebook is about finding qubits, parking them at their frequency sweetspot
and performing basic characterization.

Responsible: [Quentin Ficheux](http://qudev.slack.com/team/U024X8H54R5)

## TWPA Tuneup
This notebook leads you through the TWPA characterization and tune up procedure.

Responsible: [Ants Remm](http://qudev.slack.com/team/U3Y5WCM8Q)

## Single-shot Readout Tuneup
This notebook leads you through the steps of tuning up and characterizing
single-shot readout. It assumes that the basic qubit properties and parameters are
already known and calibrated.

## Hamiltonian Fitting and Flux Line Filters
This notebook leads you through the steps of tuning up flux line filters, an
essential step of the tuneup of two-qubit gates. It assumes single-qubit gates
are calibrated.
